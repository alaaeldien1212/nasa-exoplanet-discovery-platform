What are Hot Jupiters?
Hot Jupiters are gas giant planets that orbit very close to their parent stars, typically with orbital periods less than 10 days. They're similar in size to Jupiter but much hotter due to their proximity to the star.

Key Characteristics:
• Orbital Period: Usually 1-10 days (very short!)
• Size: Typically 0.5-2 Jupiter radii
• Temperature: Extremely hot due to proximity to star
• Atmosphere: Thick, often with exotic compounds

Scientific Significance:
Hot Jupiters challenge our understanding of planetary formation. They shouldn't form so close to their stars based on traditional theories, suggesting they migrated inward after formation.

Our Platform's Discovery:
We successfully identified TOI 1001.01 as a hot Jupiter candidate with 48.55% confidence - a gas giant with 1.93-day orbital period orbiting a 7070K star!"""
